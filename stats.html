          <p>
            "De" originates from "Dekyid" which means peace. "Suung" refers to
            guarding. Therefore, Desuung means "Guardians of Peace". Launched on
            February 14, 2011 by the fifth King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel
            Wangchuck, the De-suung programme aims to encourage citizens to take
            up a role in nation-building.

            Otherwise, we are doomed to suffer from scanty rainfall,
            earthquakes, landslides and windstorms destroying the houses and
            crops frequently since our local deity is not really satisfied and

            introduced in Bhutan. Such mind set was carried on by our parents

            missed or challenged them by not sacrificing animals instead.

            twenty-one taras and the two most popular ones are White Tara and
            Green Tara. It is said that these goddesses of compassion wept tears
            for the beings of samsara. One can differentiate between the two
            Taras by looking at the colour of the lotus held on their hand. Many
            believe that if the male pays homage to Tara and chants prayers,
            good things will befall the believers.

          Bhunna in Urdu means "to be fried" so the Bhuna curry is another
          cooking style rather than a specific set of ingredients. So although
          considered by many as a type of curry dish, bhuna is actually a
          cooking technique whereby a mix of spices are fried in very hot oil in
          order to make a paste. The meat is then fried together with this paste
          mix giving a thick intense dish.

          Momo is a staple snack (if there can be one) in Bhutanese cuisines.
          Momos are 'dumplings' made from palm-sized wheat dough sheets stuffed
          with fillings of myriad choices like meat, cheese and or vegetable
          fillings. Momo has found its footing as the most loved and must-have
          snack in Bhutan though it's believed to have its origin in
          Chinese/Tibetan cuisines. There's little doubt why it shouldn't be on
